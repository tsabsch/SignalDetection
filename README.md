# SignalDetection

This repository contains an analysis of the [HEPMASS](archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HEPMASS) data set from the _UCI Machine Learning Repository_. It's goal is to detect signals generated by particle-producing collisions. The analysis consists of the following parts:

* Description of the data set and its attributes
* Data preprocessing (e.g. Cleaning, handling missing values, ...)
* Classification by several classification strategies
* Evaluation of the results

This analysis has been made as part of the course [__Advanced Topics in Machine Learning__](http://www.findke.ovgu.de/findke/en/Studies/Courses/Summer+Term+2017/Advanced+Topics+in+Machine+Learning.html) at the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg.
